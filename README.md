## Welcome to the Hugging Face Backup & Image Zipper

This notebook provides a suite of interactive widgets designed to streamline the entire process of preparing and uploading files to your Hugging Face repositories.

Each step has been enhanced with "smart" features to provide clear feedback, prevent common errors, and accelerate your workflow.

## Workflow at a Glance

This notebook is organized into a simple, step-by-step process. Just run the cells in order.

1.  **⚙️ Setup & Validate Environment:** The first cell installs all necessary packages and then **validates** the environment, confirming that all tools and the `hf` CLI are ready to use.
2.  **🔑 Secure Authentication:** The login cell **checks your current login status** first. If you need to log in, it will then **validate your token** to ensure it has the correct `write` permissions required for uploading.
3.  **🗂️ (Optional) Zip Your Images:** Use the **Smart Image Zipper** to prepare your image datasets. It allows you to filter by file type and **analyze a folder** to see a preview of the archive size *before* zipping.
4.  **🚀 Upload to the Hub:** The **Smart Uploader** widget provides a powerful interface for uploading your files, supporting concurrent uploads, single-commit mode, and automatic repository creation.

## Key Features Across the Toolkit
-   **Interactive Widgets:** Manage your entire workflow without writing complex scripts.
-   **Environment Validation:** Confidence that your setup is correct from the very beginning.
-   **Secure Login with Permission Checks:** Prevents upload failures due to incorrect token permissions.
-   **Pre-Zip Analysis:** Analyze image folders to know the size and file count before you zip.
-   **Advanced Upload Options:** Choose between single-commit mode for clean history or concurrent uploads for speed.
-   **Fast Uploads:** Automatically uses `hf_transfer` to speed up large file transfers.
-   **Live Progress Bars:** Monitor progress during both zipping and uploading.
